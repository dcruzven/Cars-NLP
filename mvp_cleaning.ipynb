But my first warning sign was the engine was losing oil almost immediately- I set my oil changes for 5,000 miles. By the time I had an oil change it was right at a quart low. I thought it was a fluke and got 10,000 mile oil as I am very busy and it saves time. At 7,500 miles the truck was 2.5 Qts low on oil. I switched to 3,000 mile oil and oil changes then. The engine was also  making a plastic raspy noise whenever I let off the accelerator. Fast forward to this June. At this point Ive had the truck 3.5yrs, 86,000 miles. Never missed an oil change/service. The engine light starts flashing. So I have it towed to a local mechanic thinking it was maybe coil packs. He was stumped. Next have it towed to the Ford dealership. They call me today saying it has multiple cam timing issues. The cost to fix it is $4,700!!!!!  FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED.... The whole reason I invested in a new truck was so that I would have something that would be dependable for many years. Instead, I get a new truck that hasn't even lasted as long as the used trucks I've bought. I could not be anymore more disappointed and angrier with the quality of this truck.

Also I was able to sell it pretty high price ($4,500) comparing the year and the mileage (over 200,0000 miles). So that is one of the reason why I bought Rav4 again.', \"I've have a Rav 4 premium wich was purchased in feb2021.ive had zero problems and the car accelerates like a rx350 which I cannot understand where people want to tell you the car is slow . the car was purchased because of extreme back problems which I am on disabled for.the car does everything as well as my dad's girlfriend's 2017 Rx 350.the gas mileage is amazing.\", 'Amazing performance for a 4 cylinder.

The vehicle is a blast to drive, yet can carry the whole family and luggage anywhere.I had a few e36 m3s a while back and repairs were reasonable and easy to do a lot of stuff independently, so repair costs (only needed brakes, tires and oil in the past 30k miles) on the new BMWs did come as a bit of a shock, but being proactive helps. The vehicle has been super reliable with no mechanical issues., Love my X3 SDrive 30i, it has a very smooth ride and a very powerful turbo engine, it’s very spacious and has a very nice interior, I like the infotainment and the touchscreen, and you also have a manual control next to the gearshift. I also like the fact that the map on the Nav system is updated from the cloud and not a disk or chip. This is my first BMW and I am very very pleased with it, I previously had a 2013 Lexus LS460L, I loved that car but I thought it was just too big for me being a single man. The X3 is just right for me, Ive lost count of how many BMWs Ive owned, and will never drive anything else.  Ride, comfort, experience, feel, quality, workmanship, amazing engineering, quiet, ... on and on.  They are precision instruments and a joy to drive, even to just the store and back.  Others included 328i, M3, M550i.  All equally unbelievable.'"
