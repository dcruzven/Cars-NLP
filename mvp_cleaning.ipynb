But my first warning sign was the engine was losing oil almost immediately- I set my oil changes for 5,000 miles. By the time I had an oil change it was right at a quart low. I thought it was a fluke and got 10,000 mile oil as I am very busy and it saves time. At 7,500 miles the truck was 2.5 Qts low on oil. I switched to 3,000 mile oil and oil changes then. The engine was also  making a plastic raspy noise whenever I let off the accelerator. Fast forward to this June. At this point Ive had the truck 3.5yrs, 86,000 miles. Never missed an oil change/service. The engine light starts flashing. So I have it towed to a local mechanic thinking it was maybe coil packs. He was stumped. Next have it towed to the Ford dealership. They call me today saying it has multiple cam timing issues. The cost to fix it is $4,700!!!!!  FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED.... The whole reason I invested in a new truck was so that I would have something that would be dependable for many years. Instead, I get a new truck that hasn't even lasted as long as the used trucks I've bought. I could not be anymore more disappointed and angrier with the quality of this truck. It's a pretty truck, but if you want something dependable, look elsewhere.\", \"Luxury? Check. Utility? Check. \\r\\nWhat can you say about an $80k truck?

Fake propaganda says they are expensive to repair which is the worst lie perpetrated in the automotive world.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",

Interior is easy to clean, the fabric on the seats is sporty. Rides smooth for being a pickup and I would say I averaged about 19 to 20 miles per gallon on the city. Definitely recommend this truck, I would definitely lean towards the ECOBOOST engine. The 2.7 is plenty of power and runs awesome. If you want an extra kick go with the 3.5, if your pulling a trailer around. Also the app for FORD on the phone was great. It gave you all the basic info on the truck anywhere.

But my first warning sign was the engine was losing oil almost immediately- I set my oil changes for 5,000 miles. By the time I had an oil change it was right at a quart low. I thought it was a fluke and got 10,000 mile oil as I am very busy and it saves time. At 7,500 miles the truck was 2.5 Qts low on oil. I switched to 3,000 mile oil and oil changes then. The engine was also  making a plastic raspy noise whenever I let off the accelerator. Fast forward to this June. At this point Ive had the truck 3.5yrs, 86,000 miles. Never missed an oil change/service. The engine light starts flashing. So I have it towed to a local mechanic thinking it was maybe coil packs. He was stumped. Next have it towed to the Ford dealership. They call me today saying it has multiple cam timing issues. The cost to fix it is $4,700!!!!!  FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED.... The whole reason I invested in a new truck was so that I would have something that would be dependable for many years. Instead, I get a new truck that hasn't even lasted as long as the used trucks I've bought. I could not be anymore more disappointed and angrier with the quality of this truck. It's a pretty truck, but if you want something dependable, look elsewhere.\", \"Luxury? Check. Utility? Check. \\r\\nWhat can you say about an $80k truck?

I would recommend this to all my friends !, After haven driving several new heavy duty diesel pickups I decided to go with the Chevrolet. The L5P engine is powerful, and Of course they’re all powerful these days. But this truck is fast, faster than my most of my friends trucks that have aftermarket tunes. Faster than my neighbors tuned 6.7 ford. 2019 was the last year of the real Allison transmission 6 speed so that’s a plus also. The new trucks have a GM 10 speed. The truck seems to be rock solid so far. No real issues yet. Hauled number ours heavy trailers and haven’t had an issue. Truck is my daily driver and rides great. It rides just like a half ton.'"

       "After 9800 miles and being towed 5 times, i would not recommend this truck for reliability for anything. I contacted Ford after being towed the 3rd time, and they said they couldn’t help me to resolve the issue, that i needed to take it for service. 3 fuel pumps later, I traded it for a chevy… couldn’t be happier. Nothing worse than be stranded on 2 lane highways between Oklahoma and Montana and feeling hopeless with little cell phone service. Don’t buy, they don’t stand behind their product , Love my2019 f-150  sport truck Nice power. For a 2.7. Twin turbo. This truck will move  nice gas mileage I get 20 city. About 24 high way.  It Drives.nice  handles well. For a big truck. No wonder it’s the  Best selling truck the last 40 years   , Best truck out there! Plenty of room for the grandkids seats and 4 people. Also, plenty of room in the bed for working/hauling materials. And all of this can happen at the same time. All of the HP youll need for anything. Recently hauled a load of heavy furniture and other household stuff over Monteagle mountain and I was passing cars going up the mountain!!

       "For such a good truck it sad that Ford was so cheap when they made the slide plate. The slide plate is made out of cardboard. , F150 Crew Cab STX package, 2WD, with Ecoboost 2.7. WOW! Super impressed with the fuel economy and power on this pickup. Bought it new, it was a great buy. A lot of space in the interior. Big screen display on the radio. Interior is easy to clean, the fabric on the seats is sporty. Rides smooth for being a pickup and I would say I averaged about 19 to 20 miles per gallon on the city. Definitely recommend this truck, I would definitely lean towards the ECOBOOST engine. The 2.7 is plenty of power and runs awesome. If you want an extra kick go with the 3.5, if your pulling a trailer around. Also the app for FORD on the phone was great. It gave you all the basic info on the truck anywhere. Parked location, odometer, fuel, tire pressure and a lot more. Great buy! , Safe, Comfy, Saves value, Cheap maintenanceI love this car.Powerful with less gas but you should know how to drive a V6 truck, never go back to Jeep after Ford                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      64\n",
       "2018 XTL, 4X4, 302A Package 48000 mi. Other than wheel bearings, the vehicle has been flawless. Lots of room and the 2.7L has pep and is economical to operate. My major complaint is OE running boards, the chrome peels. No issues with the motor or transmission. Only expense other than fluid changes was new front brakes. This vehicle is driven in Northern Ontario and performs remarkably well in snow and rough roads. The 5 bed is perfect for our needs of hauling material for our DIY projects. We have hauled up to 3/4 yard of gravel without any difficulty It is the best vehicle I have ever owned., I bought my truck new on Dec 30th of 2018. I initially loved it. But my first warning sign was the engine was losing oil almost immediately- I set my oil changes for 5,000 miles. By the time I had an oil change it was right at a quart low. I thought it was a fluke and got 10,000 mile oil as I am very busy and it saves time. At 7,500 miles the truck was 2.5 Qts low on oil. I switched to 3,000 mile oil and oil changes then. The engine was also  making a plastic raspy noise whenever I let off the accelerator. Fast forward to this June. At this point Ive had the truck 3.5yrs, 86,000 miles. Never missed an oil change/service. The engine light starts flashing. So I have it towed to a local mechanic thinking it was maybe coil packs. He was stumped. Next have it towed to the Ford dealership. They call me today saying it has multiple cam timing issues. The cost to fix it is $4,700!!!!!  FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED.... The whole reason I invested in a new truck was so that I would have something that would be dependable for many years. Instead, I get a new truck that hasnt even lasted as long as the used trucks Ive bought. I could not be anymore more disappointed and angrier with the quality of this truck. Its a pretty truck, but if you want something dependable, look elsewhere., Luxury? Check. Utility? Check. What can you say about an $80k truck? Take the body of a workhorse F150 and squeeze in the cabin of a Lincoln. The 3.5L turbo Ecoboost has absolutely no issues moving this massive truck around. The 10 speed transmission is smooth to the point that I rarely feel it shift. Even when towing or with the box loaded. The cabin is eerily quit and supremely comfortable. The heated, cooled and massage(!) seats make even the longest road trip a pleasant experience. Read seat passengers will appreciate the heated rear seats, and plenty of usb, 12v and 110v charging options.Ive put 55k miles on this truck, and the only mechanical issue Ive experienced is a problem with the power running boards not fully extending. For a full size pickup, the ride is surprisingly smooth and the included driver assist features will make a lazy driver out of anyone.If you want a vehicle with the capabilities of a truck, and the comfort of a luxury sedan you cant go wrong with the F150 Limited.    54\n",
       "This is a great all-around truck that blends luxury features with a solid truck. With coil suspension on all wheels, it makes for a very soft and comfortable ride, while being able to tow anything you can throw its way. , Love my truck, interior and exterior. Would not give up the suspension, and comfortable ride.  Yes with gas prices now it does take more $$ to fill up but its still  a better ride than any other car I have owned. , After owning 13 previous Chevy and GMC 1500 and 2500 pickups, I decided to purchase a 21 1500 RAM Laramie. I absolutely love the truck from the quiet and luxurious interior to the rugged exterior styling. The truck does everything I need it too and more!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    53\n",
       "I love everything about this car. Everything is exactly asThey claim the car is. Buy one you won’t be sorry. You don’t have to wait for a new one—a used one is justas good, even better. , Car rides very comfortable.  Nice design and detail.  Very happy with this car.  Would buy again, but realized I didn’t get everything I wanted on the car., I wanted to buy this car when I was in China. I bought a second-hand car in The IDEAL AUTO. Except for the ugly center console, the cars power and ride comfort are all right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                51\n",

       "This car looks and feels great. Comfort,style and fells great on the road. The test drive made me fall in love with this car. Very roomy and enough trunk space  for my needs, This car is absolutely perfect - its compact, reliable, the seats fold down and theres a lot of room! It handles INCREDIBLY and is so comfortable for long drives. There is limited leg room in the back seat so I wouldnt recommend this vehicle for a family or people who need a lot of space., The Juke is very different looking at is really fun. You have all kinds of people looking at you in the car and you can try to figure out if they like it or think its weird. Then when you drive you have so much fun! Quick, easy,  trendy.. all positive adjectives!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",

       "We love our little 2015 Tucson! Perfect size! The car just wraps around me when I get into the driver’s seat.  Great little runabout!It is Red and the 2015 Tucson is the most beautiful shade of bright RED! Adorable and substantial car., I bought the 2015 Tucson GLS last year Sept 2019. The inside and exterior looks wonderful and it has bluetooth for convenience. At 70k mi the engine seized without warning on the freeway putting my family at risk. The engine blew, the hood went straight up covering the windshield. Hyundai Motors Customer Care is looking into this. I only had the car 1 year and changed the oil to synthetic before Hyundais yearly recommendation.  This is a serious safety hazard. I bought this car to safely transport my disabled grandson to Rady Childrens Hosp. for appts. Luckily he wasnt in it when this happened, This car meets all my needs.

       "I am the 2nd owner of this car. I purchased it with 16900 mi on it. I have had 2 Cadillacs, 2 Acura MDX and a Lincoln MKS. This Continental Reserve is my most favorite of all. Beautiful to look at, amazing twin turbo performance, and truly comfortable to drive. I live in Alaska with a lot of winter driving and this AWD car gets around very well. Love Love Love it ! , I love everything about the car even massages while driving. Comfort style and handling is the best. I love sound system, accent lighting and 30 way seating.  Very happy customer., It drives good and had everything I wanted in a vehicle  I got a good price and purchasing was so easy and the sales person was very helpful and answered all my questions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",
       "This is the best family car I’ve owned. The kids have their own entertainment while I can listen to my own music. Accessing the third row is no problem as the seat in the middle is removable and the pilot seats slide to the side, making it easy to get to the third row even when the pilot seats have car seats. It’s a wonderful car! , This van is AWFUL. Absolutely would not recommend it to anyone. It’s not safe. It has broken down on the highway THREE times. We have a dog & two toddlers. There is something wrong with the transmission yet Brandon Honda Dealership & Honda corporate won’t address the issues. The first time it broke down without warning was after buying it BRAND NEW & having less than 300 miles on it. The transmission went out completely. Do NOT BUY A HONDA ODYSSEY. , This is a brand new car, so all we can base this on is the ride home from purchasing it.  We traded in a 2014 Toyota Sienna AWD Limited which had been a good car, but it was lacking refinements in its information/entertainment center, and it was quite noisy and rough.  We can only judge from the 100+ miles we put on the Odyssey so far, but it is luxurious and smooth riding and quiet.  The drive on two-lane rough roads and interstate was wonderful.  There are too many features to mention here, but we are sure we made the right decision in purchasing this beautifully designed car.  Even the exterior has a very special look.  We purchased the white with beige interior and love it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
