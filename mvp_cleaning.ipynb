But my first warning sign was the engine was losing oil almost immediately- I set my oil changes for 5,000 miles. By the time I had an oil change it was right at a quart low. I thought it was a fluke and got 10,000 mile oil as I am very busy and it saves time. At 7,500 miles the truck was 2.5 Qts low on oil. I switched to 3,000 mile oil and oil changes then. The engine was also  making a plastic raspy noise whenever I let off the accelerator. Fast forward to this June. At this point Ive had the truck 3.5yrs, 86,000 miles. Never missed an oil change/service. The engine light starts flashing. So I have it towed to a local mechanic thinking it was maybe coil packs. He was stumped. Next have it towed to the Ford dealership. They call me today saying it has multiple cam timing issues. The cost to fix it is $4,700!!!!!  FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED.... The whole reason I invested in a new truck was so that I would have something that would be dependable for many years. Instead, I get a new truck that hasn't even lasted as long as the used trucks I've bought. I could not be anymore more disappointed and angrier with the quality of this truck. It's a pretty truck, but if you want something dependable, look elsewhere.\", \"Luxury? Check. Utility? Check. \\r\\nWhat can you say about an $80k truck?

Plenty of traction and handles very well in winter driving areas.\\n\\nThis is my second TDI, first one was bought out by VW during buy backs.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",

Super impressed with the fuel economy and power on this pickup. Bought it new, it was a great buy. A lot of space in the interior. Big screen display on the radio. Interior is easy to clean, the fabric on the seats is sporty. Rides smooth for being a pickup and I would say I averaged about 19 to 20 miles per gallon on the city. Definitely recommend this truck, I would definitely lean towards the ECOBOOST engine. The 2.7 is plenty of power and runs awesome. If you want an extra kick go with the 3.5, if your pulling a trailer around. Also the app for FORD on the phone was great. It gave you all the basic info on the truck anywhere.

But my first warning sign was the engine was losing oil almost immediately- I set my oil changes for 5,000 miles. By the time I had an oil change it was right at a quart low. I thought it was a fluke and got 10,000 mile oil as I am very busy and it saves time. At 7,500 miles the truck was 2.5 Qts low on oil. I switched to 3,000 mile oil and oil changes then. The engine was also  making a plastic raspy noise whenever I let off the accelerator. Fast forward to this June. At this point Ive had the truck 3.5yrs, 86,000 miles. Never missed an oil change/service. The engine light starts flashing. So I have it towed to a local mechanic thinking it was maybe coil packs. He was stumped. Next have it towed to the Ford dealership. They call me today saying it has multiple cam timing issues. The cost to fix it is $4,700!!!!!  FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED.... The whole reason I invested in a new truck was so that I would have something that would be dependable for many years. Instead, I get a new truck that hasn't even lasted as long as the used trucks I've bought. I could not be anymore more disappointed and angrier with the quality of this truck. It's a pretty truck, but if you want something dependable, look elsewhere.\", \"Luxury? Check. Utility? Check. \\r\\nWhat can you say about an $80k truck?

Plenty of traction and handles very well in winter driving areas.\\n\\nThis is my second TDI, first one was bought out by VW during buy backs.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",

I would recommend this to all my friends !, After haven driving several new heavy duty diesel pickups I decided to go with the Chevrolet. The L5P engine is powerful, and Of course they’re all powerful these days. But this truck is fast, faster than my most of my friends trucks that have aftermarket tunes. Faster than my neighbors tuned 6.7 ford. 2019 was the last year of the real Allison transmission 6 speed so that’s a plus also. The new trucks have a GM 10 speed. The truck seems to be rock solid so far. No real issues yet. Hauled number ours heavy trailers and haven’t had an issue. Truck is my daily driver and rides great. It rides just like a half ton.'"

       "After 9800 miles and being towed 5 times, i would not recommend this truck for reliability for anything. I contacted Ford after being towed the 3rd time, and they said they couldn’t help me to resolve the issue, that i needed to take it for service. 3 fuel pumps later, I traded it for a chevy… couldn’t be happier. Nothing worse than be stranded on 2 lane highways between Oklahoma and Montana and feeling hopeless with little cell phone service. Don’t buy, they don’t stand behind their product , Love my2019 f-150  sport truck Nice power. For a 2.7. Twin turbo. This truck will move  nice gas mileage I get 20 city. About 24 high way.  It Drives.nice  handles well. For a big truck. No wonder it’s the  Best selling truck the last 40 years   , Best truck out there! Plenty of room for the grandkids seats and 4 people. Also, plenty of room in the bed for working/hauling materials. And all of this can happen at the same time. All of the HP youll need for anything. Recently hauled a load of heavy furniture and other household stuff over Monteagle mountain and I was passing cars going up the mountain!!

       "For such a good truck it sad that Ford was so cheap when they made the slide plate. The slide plate is made out of cardboard. , F150 Crew Cab STX package, 2WD, with Ecoboost 2.7. WOW! Super impressed with the fuel economy and power on this pickup. Bought it new, it was a great buy. A lot of space in the interior. Big screen display on the radio. Interior is easy to clean, the fabric on the seats is sporty. Rides smooth for being a pickup and I would say I averaged about 19 to 20 miles per gallon on the city. Definitely recommend this truck, I would definitely lean towards the ECOBOOST engine. The 2.7 is plenty of power and runs awesome. If you want an extra kick go with the 3.5, if your pulling a trailer around. Also the app for FORD on the phone was great. It gave you all the basic info on the truck anywhere. Parked location, odometer, fuel, tire pressure and a lot more. Great buy! , Safe, Comfy, Saves value, Cheap maintenanceI love this car.Powerful with less gas but you should know how to drive a V6 truck, never go back to Jeep after Ford                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      64\n",
       "2018 XTL, 4X4, 302A Package 48000 mi. Other than wheel bearings, the vehicle has been flawless. Lots of room and the 2.7L has pep and is economical to operate. My major complaint is OE running boards, the chrome peels. No issues with the motor or transmission. Only expense other than fluid changes was new front brakes. This vehicle is driven in Northern Ontario and performs remarkably well in snow and rough roads. The 5 bed is perfect for our needs of hauling material for our DIY projects. We have hauled up to 3/4 yard of gravel without any difficulty It is the best vehicle I have ever owned., I bought my truck new on Dec 30th of 2018. I initially loved it. But my first warning sign was the engine was losing oil almost immediately- I set my oil changes for 5,000 miles. By the time I had an oil change it was right at a quart low. I thought it was a fluke and got 10,000 mile oil as I am very busy and it saves time. At 7,500 miles the truck was 2.5 Qts low on oil. I switched to 3,000 mile oil and oil changes then. The engine was also  making a plastic raspy noise whenever I let off the accelerator. Fast forward to this June. At this point Ive had the truck 3.5yrs, 86,000 miles. Never missed an oil change/service. The engine light starts flashing. So I have it towed to a local mechanic thinking it was maybe coil packs. He was stumped. Next have it towed to the Ford dealership. They call me today saying it has multiple cam timing issues. The cost to fix it is $4,700!!!!!  FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED.... The whole reason I invested in a new truck was so that I would have something that would be dependable for many years. Instead, I get a new truck that hasnt even lasted as long as the used trucks Ive bought. I could not be anymore more disappointed and angrier with the quality of this truck. Its a pretty truck, but if you want something dependable, look elsewhere., Luxury? Check. Utility? Check. What can you say about an $80k truck? Take the body of a workhorse F150 and squeeze in the cabin of a Lincoln. The 3.5L turbo Ecoboost has absolutely no issues moving this massive truck around. The 10 speed transmission is smooth to the point that I rarely feel it shift. Even when towing or with the box loaded. The cabin is eerily quit and supremely comfortable. The heated, cooled and massage(!) seats make even the longest road trip a pleasant experience. Read seat passengers will appreciate the heated rear seats, and plenty of usb, 12v and 110v charging options.Ive put 55k miles on this truck, and the only mechanical issue Ive experienced is a problem with the power running boards not fully extending. For a full size pickup, the ride is surprisingly smooth and the included driver assist features will make a lazy driver out of anyone.If you want a vehicle with the capabilities of a truck, and the comfort of a luxury sedan you cant go wrong with the F150 Limited.    54\n",
       "This is a great all-around truck that blends luxury features with a solid truck. With coil suspension on all wheels, it makes for a very soft and comfortable ride, while being able to tow anything you can throw its way. , Love my truck, interior and exterior. Would not give up the suspension, and comfortable ride.  Yes with gas prices now it does take more $$ to fill up but its still  a better ride than any other car I have owned. , After owning 13 previous Chevy and GMC 1500 and 2500 pickups, I decided to purchase a 21 1500 RAM Laramie. I absolutely love the truck from the quiet and luxurious interior to the rugged exterior styling. The truck does everything I need it too and more!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    53\n",
       "A little too big for myself but I love this car.I had a used Rav4 before, drove about 10 years, loved it. Also I was able to sell it pretty high price ($4,500) comparing the year and the mileage (over 200,0000 miles). So that is one of the reason why I bought Rav4 again., Ive have a Rav 4 premium wich was purchased in feb2021.ive had zero problems and the car accelerates like a rx350 which I cannot understand where people want to tell you the car is slow . the car was purchased because of extreme back problems which I am on disabled for.the car does everything as well as my dads girlfriends 2017 Rx 350.the gas mileage is amazing., Amazing performance for a 4 cylinder. First time I ever owned something without a V8, and I am impressed.Good handling. great interior and very comfortable. Good MPG also.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             51\n",

       "Cool little van but the heating system does not work. You cant use this thing in the winter. The doors freeze shut and the heat does not work well enough to thaw them out. Death trap in the winter., This is reliable little van and I took it road tripping every year and then would double it as a handicap van for my grandson, he is in a wheelchair.  It worked well until my grandson grew up and needed a traditional conversion handicap van.  The only complaint I have is the back driver tire had some flaw, it would have to be replaced before the others and would develop a bubble., We have several dogs. Low step in height.

Better for parking lots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",
       "The car I always wanted. Paid $28,000 for the car and spend $26,000 in repairs using my 3rd party warranty. Car is like new and fun to drive. Repairs were split even between engine, roof and roof hydraulic. The car had only 24K miles on when I bought it. Car is a bless to drive., Bought car in February ‘22. Wow. It is a great vehicle. I know I am in the honeymoon stage but… so what? Performance, especially lane changes, is  notable and fun. Increased acceleration when briefly passing, is so satisfying. The roof is magical. With top up, the car is luxurious; down, sporty. The seats are comfortable, I love everything about this car! The fit, finish, design, performance and sound are all phenomenal. Exceeded my expectations in every aspect! If you like flashy cars and people looking at you, this car is for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
       "The car is great for those that like older convertible vehicles with lots of horse power! This is a great show vehicle that we have taken to lots of car shows and is fun to drive on those great summer nights!, Its fast, super hot, ladies wanna be in it, guys wanna be you. Pick up a foxbody, mod it out with some bolt-ons and hit the strip!, I havent put a lot of miles on it, but i would take it anywhere. Fun car. The car i should have had in 86. Glad I bought it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
       "This car is great and handles well, its summer now I know I am good for the summer, cant wait to see how it handles in the winter., We traded in our GLK (2011) for the replacement GLC 300...We loved the GLK, but it was approaching 100,000 miles and decided to trade it in for the new GLC 300.  We couldnt be happier.  It exceeded our expectations. Room, handling and response are all excellent. Plenty of space for all our stuff and the gas mileage is outstanding., I purchased the 2016 glc and returned it 3 months later. The back seat has no leg room and interior feels to small also with only 53k miles check engine light came on benz don’t make cars like the use too this is my third and last suv with them I’m going to Lexus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
       "I read a few of the other reviews so I will not repeat what others have said.  I wanted a Limited, but I could only find a base model with AWD.  I almost didnt buy it, but that would have been a mistake.  The base model with AWD comes with the heat pump which is a plus.  I purchased in NJ and drove it back to AL for FREE.  The 2 years of 30-minutes free charging at Electrify America charging stations is wonderful. You get free 30-minute sessions per charging location.  Drive another 200-250 miles to the next charging station and tou get another 30 minutes of charging for free.  Yes, it charges from 10% to 80% in 15-20 minutes if you use a 350kW charger.  The max charging rate i experienced was 245 kW.  Most of the charging stations are in the parking lot of a Super Wal-Mart withing 2 miles of an interstate exit.  I find that I dont miss all the things I thought I would miss from the higher trims.  The fabric seats are comfortable and the Scotch Guard works extremely well.  I miss a rear windshield wiper, but I treated the glass with RainX and that has worked well.  If all you can find is a base model with AWD, go for it!  I would hesitate on a base model with RWD if acceleration matters to you., This is my 4th EV, almost 4k miles in a month (bought the car in NY and drove it back to CA). Ride is very comfortable, you get all the options with the limited trim which is very nice. Very roomy inside and comes with all the latest safety technology., This is my second electric car, I think the Engineers took it out of the stadium with this design, it has a good range per charge, the interior design is very futuristic, it is very spacious, the passengers in the back have enough space and the seats are very comfortable They can also recline and move backwards or forwards. The battery consumption according to the driving style, be it sport, normal or Eco, is very good. There are plenty of fast chargers not only at the DMV, but all over the East Coast, they charge from 10% to 80% in about 15 to 18 minutes.The only drawback I saw with this car is that it does not have a rear windshield wiper. I dont know if this is because in all my previous cars I had it and Im used to having good visibility when it rains and snows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
