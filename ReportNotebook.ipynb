    "This project focuses on trying to predict a price range for a used car. This is to help the client have a starting point for a price range. The data was web-scraped from Cars.com. The data scraped came from 9k used cars in Alabama. The data was very messy and a lot of steps were taken to clean it. This included extracting certain words, turning number details into actual numeric values for models. This was then taken to a couple of models. The best model was an XGBoost model. A good accuracy scored was recieved to satisfy the clients."

    "Using Cars.com gave the basics of a car including a sale price. This is information anyone can look up when looking for a used car, so it is the best information to use in order to predict a sale price range. The reviews were also gathered, it is additional information that could be useful. The review of a car could have an effect on the price, this will be explored. \n",
    "\n",
    "There were some limitations and problems that the data has. There were only ~9k entries, this is okay but more would have been better. Since it was web-scraped, some information of the cars were not saved. At times the incorrect value would be in the incorrect column. The data also came out very messy so a lot of data cleaning would have to be done. The review portion of the data also has limitations. Although ~9k reviews were colleceted, only a portion (1.8k) were unique. This is because the same model cars also used the same reviews. This would limit how accurate a model can predict a sale price range due to the amount of repeated reviews. "

Both Gasoline and Automatic made up 95% of the values in their respective columns. This would not help the models at all since those columns essentially have a single value to predict. \n",

    "This brought us down to clean the last column, 'Engine'. With the 'Engine' column we can extract the size of the motor (ex. 3.5L) and the number of cyliders (ex. v6). Two seperate columns were created to for the engine size and number of cylinders. A big issue arrived, the data was not consistant accross the columns (incorrect values, different notation). To help with this, two indicator columns were made to check if they were in the correct format or not. By indexing through the indicator columns, we could then fill in the correct values for each column. "
